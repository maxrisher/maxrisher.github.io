          CalendarThat takes any text from your browser (emails, highlighted
          text) or direct input and converts it into calendar events using large
          language models (LLMs). You can create between 1-10 events from a
          single input, with an average creation time of just 1.4 ± 0.7 seconds
          per request.

            The problem: manual calendaring
          </h2>
          <p class="text-gray-600">
            It's easy to forget. Last week, forgetting to add a neighborhood
            cookout to my calendar led me to miss the event. Manual event
            creation has been a minor annoyance in my life ever since I started
            using Google Calendar six years ago. I believe I could lead an even
            more interesting life with greater variety if I was able to keep
            track of more events like this one. This product aims to help enable
            me to do the things that I want to do by reducing the friction of
            saving events to my calendar.

          <p class="text-gray-600">
            I wanted a tool that would give me an extremely simple way to create
            calendar events on my devices, no matter where I found the events.
            CalendarThat aims to be this tool, by offering three ways to
            instantly create calendar events: via browser extension, email, and
            web.

              >Firefox</a

            another essential tool in by belt without adding complexity to my
            life (much like my password manager,

            The CalendarThat website is mostly a useful backup for those times
            when I'm not able to easily highlight text on a webpage, or when I
            come across an event outside of the browser. It ensures that no
            matter what I'm doing on my laptop, I'm able to use CalendarThat.

            automated event creation from any device (essentially all personal

          <p class="text-gray-600">
            CalendarThat is built with a core Django server and PostgreSQL
            database which makes API calls to LLM providers and tracks the
            results. This server receives user input and sends responses via the
            browser extension, web, and email user interfaces.

            CalendarThat is built on a Django server with a PostgreSQL database,

            To serve multiple browsers, I built the Chrome and Firefox

            Calendar event creation on mobile devices is very painful: opening

            also more likely to be in a rush. Unfortunately, I often encounter
            interesting events while on my phone (e.g., a text message, an
            instagram post, a picture of a poster on the street) but lack an
            easy way to create calendar events. CalendarThat can currently solve
            some of these use cases via the email interface, but it's clunky.

          <p class="text-gray-600">
            Rather than requiring users to forward emails to create calendar
            events, it would be ideal to create calendar events automatically
            from relevant emails as soon as they enter a user's inbox. An
            obvious difficulty with such an integration is that it would require
            handling all / most of the information in a user's inbox, which
            would be a significant privacy concern for many users.

          <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mb-2">Event complexity triage</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-600">
            It would be ideal to handle complex calendar events with a more
            intelligent/slower LLM and simple events with a less capable but
            faster LLM. A very sophisticated version of this tool might

          <ol class="list-decimal pl-6">
            <li>Create calendar events with a fast LLM, then</li>
            <li>
              Asynchronously check its work and make corrections with a slower
              more intelligent LLM

          <p class="text-gray-600">
            One straightforward triage option would be to create some kind of
            classification layer on top of user input to decide if some user
            input is a "complex" or "easy" event to create. The routing could
            look something like the following:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
            <li>
              Airline flights involving complicated time zone changes -> event
              creation with GPT o4 mini, or another high quality reasoning model
            </li>
            <li>
              A single event with clear event details -> event creation with
              Gemini Flash mini, or another very fast model (event creation in
              ~1.5 seconds, compared to ~5 seconds for GPT o4 mini)
            </li>
